# Pay-to-win chess

We decided to create pay-to-win chess, an exciting twist on the age-old game with something that is universally known to simply make games better: **Microtransactions**! If the game is getting a bit too hot for your liking, simply get out your credit card, buy one of our special moves, and the tides will turn before you know it!

All the items have a historical Delftse twist to them - see if you can find the references!

## Setup instructions
You will need a valid PayPal Client ID/Secret pair in order to set up a local instance of Pay-to-win chess. You can generate your own on https://developer.paypal.com/ by creating a sandbox app, after which you can fill the environment variables `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` respectively. See the `.env.*` files for an example `.env` file.

You can use the sandbox credentials provided to you on the paypal dashboard (the email should have the format `{{username}}@personal.example.com`) in order to make fake purchases in the testing environment.

After setting up your environment, simply run `npm start` to launch the app.
